Input data format:
Nr	X	Y	H

Create output .txt files based on input .txt data:
1) Consisting height measured (IS11.H.09 or similar format - ".H." matching pattern) in format:
H 	X	Y	H

2) Consisting all points measured (both IS11.H.09 and IS11.O.17 - ".H." and ".O." matching pattern) in format:
X	Y	H

4) Consisting names of points measured (both IS11.H.09 and IS11.O.17 - ".H." and ".O." matching pattern) in format:
Nr	X	Y	H

All other measurements not matching above patterns are redundant - those are not required in output (e.g. Z.PP2.04, TPS0001, RL1, etc.)
